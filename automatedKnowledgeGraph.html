    <h2>Current Projects</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Construction</h3>
    <p>This project aims to develop methods for creating knowledge graphs that incorporate information from various data types, including text, images, and structured databases. We're exploring novel deep learning architectures that can process and integrate these diverse data sources to build more comprehensive and accurate knowledge representations.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Temporal Knowledge Graph Evolution</h3>
    <p>We're working on algorithms that can capture and represent the temporal aspects of knowledge, allowing for the construction of dynamic knowledge graphs that evolve over time. This research has significant implications for tracking changes in enterprise knowledge and understanding historical trends.</p>
